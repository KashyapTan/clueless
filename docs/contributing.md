## Areas for Contribution

### High Priority

- **macOS Support** - Porting the screenshot system and DPI handling
- **MCP Server Implementations** - Gmail, Calendar, Discord, Canvas servers
- **Test Coverage** - Unit and integration tests for both Python and React
- **Accessibility** - Keyboard navigation, screen reader support

### Medium Priority

- **UI/UX Improvements** - Better theming, animations, responsive design
- **Documentation** - Tutorials, examples, video guides
- **Performance** - Optimizing streaming, reducing memory usage
- **Error Handling** - Better error messages and recovery flows

### Good First Issues

- Adding new demo MCP tools
- Improving CSS styling
- Adding TypeScript interfaces for untyped code
- Writing documentation for specific features

## Code Style

### Python

- Follow PEP 8 conventions
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Write docstrings for public functions and classes
- Use async/await for I/O-bound operations

### TypeScript / React

- Use functional components with hooks
- Define interfaces in `src/ui/types/index.ts`
- Follow the existing component structure (pages, components, hooks)
- Use CSS modules or component-scoped CSS files

### Commit Messages

Write clear, concise commit messages:

```
feat: add web search MCP server with DuckDuckGo integration
fix: resolve DPI scaling on multi-monitor Windows setups
refactor: extract screenshot logic into separate service module
docs: add MCP integration guide
```

Prefix with: `feat`, `fix`, `refactor`, `docs`, `test`, `chore`, `style`

## Pull Request Process

1. **Description**: Clearly describe what your PR does and why
2. **Scope**: Keep PRs focused on a single feature or fix
3. **Testing**: Describe how you tested your changes
4. **Screenshots**: Include before/after screenshots for UI changes
5. **Breaking Changes**: Clearly note any breaking changes

## Adding MCP Servers

If you're implementing one of the placeholder MCP servers (Gmail, Calendar, Discord, Canvas):

1. Follow the [MCP Guide](./mcp-guide.md) for the implementation pattern
2. Handle authentication securely (never commit credentials)
3. Write tool descriptions that are clear and specific for the LLM
4. Add error handling that returns user-friendly messages
5. Update `mcp_servers/config/servers.json` with your server
6. Update the documentation

## Reporting Issues
