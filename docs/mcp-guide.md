# MCP Integration Guide

This guide covers the Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration in Clueless, how to use existing tools, and how to build new ones.

## What is MCP?

The Model Context Protocol is a standardized way to give LLMs access to external tools. Think of it as a "USB port for AI" -- any tool that implements the MCP interface can be plugged into any MCP-compatible LLM application.

**Key concepts:**
- **Transport**: Clueless uses `stdio` (standard input/output) to communicate with MCP servers
- **Protocol**: JSON-RPC 2.0 over the transport layer
- **Tool Discovery**: Servers declare their available tools with JSON Schema definitions
- **Isolation**: Each MCP server runs as an independent child process

## How Tool Calls Work

```
1. User sends query
2. Backend checks for tool-calling opportunities
   - If Cloud Model: Uses native tool calling API (Anthropic/OpenAI/Gemini)
   - If Ollama: Uses non-streamed check first
3. If LLM returns a tool_call:
   a. Backend routes to the correct MCP server via McpToolManager
   b. Server executes the tool and returns the result
   c. Result is fed back to LLM
   d. Loop repeats (up to 30 rounds) until LLM gives a final text response
4. Final response is streamed to the user
```

**Important**: Tool detection is skipped when images are present in the query for some models, as vision models often struggle with simultaneous tool calling and image analysis.

## Inline Tool Registration (Ghost Process Prevention)

For tools that require deep integration with the core application (like terminal execution or system settings), Clueless uses **Inline Tool Registration**.

Instead of spawning a standalone MCP server as a child process, these tools are registered directly in the `McpToolManager`. This avoids the overhead of "ghost processes" -- servers that exist purely to provide schemas but whose execution is intercepted by the backend.

- **Implementation**: Handled via `mcp_manager.register_inline_tools(server_name, tools)`.
- **Execution**: Intercepted in `mcp_integration/handlers.py` or `mcp_integration/cloud_tool_handlers.py` and routed to a dedicated internal executor (e.g., `terminal_executor.py`).
- **Benefits**: Lower memory usage, faster startup, and deterministic lifecycle management (e.g., stopping a request immediately kills associated terminal processes).

## Tool Retrieval and Selection

As the number of available tools grows, sending all tool definitions to the LLM can exceed context limits or confuse the model. Clueless implements a **Semantic Tool Retriever** to dynamically select the most relevant tools for each query.

### How Retrieval Works

1. **Embedding**: On startup, Clueless generates semantic embeddings for all available tool names and descriptions.
2. **Query Vectorization**: When a user sends a query, it is converted into a vector using an embedding model (e.g., `nomic-embed-text` via Ollama).
3. **Similarity Search**: The retriever calculates cosine similarity between the query vector and all tool vectors.
4. **Filtering**:
   - **Always-on Tools**: Tools manually enabled by the user in Settings are always included.
   - **Top-K Matches**: The top `K` semantically similar tools are added to the list.
5. **Inference**: Only the selected subset of tools is sent to the LLM.

### Configuration

Users can configure retrieval behavior in **Settings > Tools**:
- **Top K Retrieved Tools**: Control how many semantic matches to include (default: 5).
- **Connected MCP Servers**: Manually toggle tools to be "Always On".

## Active Servers

### Demo Calculator (`demo`)

A reference implementation for testing and learning.

| Tool | Parameters | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `add` | `a: float, b: float` | Adds two numbers |
| `divide` | `a: float, b: float` | Divides two numbers (50 decimal places) |

### Filesystem Tools (`filesystem`)

File system operations with path-traversal protection.

| Tool | Parameters | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `list_directory` | `path: str` | Lists files sorted by modification time |
| `read_file` | `path: str` | Reads UTF-8 text file content |
| `write_file` | `path: str, content: str` | Writes or overwrites a file |
| `create_folder` | `path: str, folder_name: str` | Creates a new directory |
| `move_file` | `source_path: str, destination_folder: str` | Moves a file |
| `rename_file` | `source_path: str, new_name: str` | Renames a file in place |

**Security**: All paths are validated against a `BASE_PATH` to prevent directory traversal attacks.

### Web Search (`websearch`)

Internet search and web page reading capabilities.

| Tool | Parameters | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `search_web_pages` | `query: str` | Searches the web via DuckDuckGo, returns URLs and snippets |
| `read_website` | `url: str` | Reads a web page and extracts clean markdown content |

**Features**:
- Uses DuckDuckGo for privacy-respecting search
- `read_website` uses crawl4ai with stealth mode (rotating User-Agents, noise reduction, randomized timing)
- Falls back to trafilatura for content extraction if crawl4ai fails

### Terminal Tools (`terminal`)

**Handled inline — no child process spawned.** Integrated with a multi-layer security system and approval flow.

| Tool | Parameters | Description |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| `get_environment` | none | Returns OS, shell, cwd, and versions of common tools |
| `run_command` | `command, cwd, pty, background, timeout` | Runs a shell command. `pty=True` for TUIs; `background=True` for persistence. |
| `find_files` | `pattern, directory` | Glob-based file search |
| `request_session_mode` | `reason` | Request autonomous multi-step execution |
| `end_session_mode` | none | Manually end autonomous execution (note: sessions auto-expire after each turn) |
| `send_input` | `session_id, input_text` | Type into a persistent background PTY session |
| `read_output` | `session_id` | Read recent history from a background session |
| `kill_process` | `session_id` | Terminate a background session |

**Security**:
1. **Blocklist**: Prevents destructive commands (e.g., `rm -rf /`).
2. **PATH Protection**: Prevents `PATH` injection; uses a locked execution environment.
3. **Timeout**: 120s hard ceiling for foreground commands.
4. **Approval Flow**: Configurable "ask level" (Always/On-Miss/Off).

### Gmail Tools (`gmail`)

**Requires Google Account connection in Settings.**

### Placeholder Servers

These servers have skeleton files but are not yet functional:
- **Discord** - Message reading/sending via Bot Token
- **Canvas** - LMS assignment and grade retrieval

## Adding a New MCP Server

### Step 1: Create the Server

Create a new directory under `mcp_servers/servers/` with a `server.py` file:

```python
# mcp_servers/servers/my_tool/server.py
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("My Tool Name")

@mcp.tool()
def my_function(param1: str, param2: int = 10) -> str:
    """Clear description of what this tool does and when the LLM should use it.
    
    This docstring is critical -- it's the only way the LLM knows when
    and how to use your tool. Be specific about:
    - What the tool does
    - When to use it vs. other tools
    - What the parameters mean
    - What the return value contains
    """
    result = do_something(param1, param2)
    return f"Result: {result}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()  # Starts stdio transport
```

### Step 2: Register the Server

Add your server to the MCP initialization in `source/mcp_integration/manager.py` -> `init_mcp_servers()`:

```python
await mcp_manager.connect_server(
    "my_tool",                    # Server name (used in routing)
    sys.executable,               # Python interpreter
    [str(PROJECT_ROOT / "mcp_servers" / "servers" / "my_tool" / "server.py")]
)
```

Also add it to `mcp_servers/config/servers.json`:

```json
{
    "my_tool": {
        "enabled": true,
        "module": "mcp_servers.servers.my_tool.server",
        "description": "Description of what this server provides"
    }
}
```

### Step 3: Test and Restart

Test the server standalone:

```bash
python -m mcp_servers.servers.my_tool.server
```

Then restart the app. Tools are auto-discovered and registered with the LLM.

## Best Practices

### Tool Descriptions

The LLM decides which tools to use based solely on the docstring. Write descriptions that are:

- **Specific**: "Searches the web using DuckDuckGo and returns the top 5 results with titles, URLs, and snippets"
- **Action-oriented**: Start with a verb ("Reads", "Creates", "Searches")
- **Contextual**: Explain when to use this tool vs. others
- **Parameter-aware**: Describe what each parameter expects

### Error Handling

Return errors as strings rather than raising exceptions:

```python
@mcp.tool()
def safe_tool(path: str) -> str:
    """Does something safely."""
    try:
        result = risky_operation(path)
        return f"Success: {result}"
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return f"Error: File not found at {path}"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Error: {str(e)}"
```

### Descriptions File Pattern

For complex tools, keep docstrings in a separate `descriptions.py` file:

```python
# mcp_servers/servers/my_tool/descriptions.py
MY_FUNCTION_DESC = """
Detailed multi-line description that guides the LLM
on exactly how and when to use this tool.
"""

# mcp_servers/servers/my_tool/server.py
from .descriptions import MY_FUNCTION_DESC

@mcp.tool(description=MY_FUNCTION_DESC)
def my_function(item_id: str) -> str:
    ...
```

## Debugging

### Check Server Registration

Look for `[MCP]` log entries on startup:

```
[MCP] Connecting to server: my_tool
[MCP] Server my_tool connected, discovered 2 tools
[MCP] Registered tool: my_function (server: my_tool)
```

### Test Tool Execution

Tool calls appear as cards in the UI:

```
+------------------------------------------+
| TOOL: my_function                        |
| Server: my_tool                          |
| Arguments: {"param1": "test"}            |
| Result: "Success: ..."                   |
+------------------------------------------+
```

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|-------|-----|
| Tool not discovered | Missing type hints | Add type annotations to all parameters |
| Tool never called | Poor docstring | Rewrite with clearer description |
| Server crash on startup | Missing dependency | Check `requirements.txt` and install deps |
| "Tool call timeout" | Long-running operation | Add async support or increase timeout |
| Tools not used with images | By design | Tool detection is skipped when images are in context for some models |
