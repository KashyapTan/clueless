"""
App-owned thread pool for running blocking functions.

Python's default ``ThreadPoolExecutor`` (the one ``asyncio.to_thread`` uses)
gets shut down when the event-loop or Uvicorn exits.  Once that happens every
subsequent ``asyncio.to_thread()`` call raises::

    RuntimeError: cannot schedule new futures after shutdown

By owning our own executor we avoid that entirely.  Every module that
previously called ``asyncio.to_thread(fn, ...)`` should instead::

    from source.core.thread_pool import run_in_thread
    result = await run_in_thread(fn, ...)
